# Gutenberg Fiction Books Genre ClassiÔ¨Åcation

## Objective:
This  project is intended to solve a classification task on a subset of Gutenberg Corpus of fiction books with a focus on extracting handcrafted features and evaluating models based on genre classification.

## Dataset:
subset of Gutenberg Corpus consisting of around 996 books. These books are labelled
with the genre they belong to and we had to mainly focus on classification of the books and predict their genre. 

## Project Goal:
The major focus was to extract handcrafted features rather than aligning to generic concepts of text classification
and retrieval like Bag of Words (BOW) model or word2vec embedding.The major motivation here was to use classification techniques that uses an approach of learning features which are not traditionally used rather which are more intuitive or contextual to books or fiction books in general.
